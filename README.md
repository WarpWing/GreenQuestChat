# GreenQuestChat Repository
GreenQuestChat or "Gaia" is a RAG System Agent that allows users to ask in-depth queries about Dickinson College's sustainability practices and GreenQuest Solutions business records. This system utilizes LLama Index to find context in unstructured data(PDFs, Text Files) through a process called Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG. Gaia runs on GPT-4 for a base model and then uses Qdrant (Vector Search Engine) for storing documents with HuggingFace's Optimum ONNX Embeddings. 

Small note that the data covered in this repository is just a small part of what GQChat or "Gaia" has access to. The data in the repository serves as a small example.
