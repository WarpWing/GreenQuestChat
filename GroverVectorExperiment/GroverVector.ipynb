    "Grover's algorithm allows us to find a particular register or in this case vector in an unordered database with $N$ entries in just $O(\\sqrt{N})$ steps, compared to the best classical algorithm taking on average $N/2$ steps, thereby providing a __quadratic speedup__.\n",
    "\n",
    "For large databases (with a large number of entries, $N$), a quadratic speedup can provide a significant advantage. For a database with one million entries, a quantum computer running Grover's algorithm would need about 1000 runs, while a classical computer would need, on average, $500$k runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research has been shown that any optimal quantum solution to an unstructured search problem has a speed limit of $O(\\sqrt{N})$ runtime. This research finding matches the performance of Grover's algorithm, thus proving that the algorithm is asymptotically optimal. In fact, Grover's algorithm can be generalized to accelerate any type of search where one can construct a quantum oracle. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of GreenQuest's top-k scoring method, Grover's algorithm could be used to significantly improve the efficiency of searching and ranking user activities based on sustainability impact. With a vast database of user actions and their sustainability scores, Grover's algorithm could quickly identify the top-scoring actions. This efficiency is crucial for real-time applications where immediate access to the most impactful sustainability actions is necessary. Integrating Grover's algorithm into GreenQuest could theorectically enhance the platform's capability to offer quicker, more efficient services, thus fostering greater user engagement and promoting effective sustainability practices. While this Quantum Scoring System was never used in the demo version, I thought it would be cool to share it in this notebook the testing methods of what could've been. \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "Overall, these experiments did produce some interesting finds, I'm still seeing some perfect similarity scores which is interesting. Either my Top-K implementation isn't working or there's something wrong with the similarity scoring? I may want to consult someone more proficent than me. Maybe it's a issue with Vectorization or Implementation of Grover's? One note is that I'm not a expert, just a simple amateur freshman not even aiming for Computer Science. If there is anything irregular or weird in this findings that could help improve my comptency, please write me at chermsit@dickinson.edu or drop a Github Issue!"
