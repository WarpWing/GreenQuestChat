Dickinson will prepare you to be a sustainability leader. You'll develop the competencies and dispositions for creating a sustainable world through knowing and doing: studying sustainability in the classroom and abroad, conducting research, advancing campus greening efforts, practicing sustainable living skills, working in internships, serving communities and using the campus as a living laboratory in which to act on your ideas.

Through these activities of the head, heart and hands, you'll gain more than knowledge—you'll gain values, skills and confidence for leading change in the world.

To rise to this challenge, you'll need competencies and dispositions to:

    Think critically about problems of improving the human condition equitably in this and future generations, while conserving environmental systems necessary to support healthy and vibrant societies
    Solve problems by applying sustainability concepts and principles
    Communicate effectively to raise awareness, increase understanding and motivate action for sustainability
    Collaborate with others, working with and leading teams or groups to advance shared sustainability goals.

You will encounter novel challenges from globalizing social and economic institutions, transforming technologies and a growing human footprint that is rapidly changing the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, climate and ecological systems in unprecedented ways. These dynamic forces interact with and compound continuing challenges of poverty, hunger, injustice and conflict.

Our graduates need a 21st-century skill set that prepares them to integrate knowledge about such complex problems, learn from and adapt to changing conditions and envision and implement sustainable solutions.
