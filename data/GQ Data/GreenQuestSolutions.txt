C. GreenQuest Leadership Philosophy 
-	What are our common values? 
Our common values as a team are rather simple and are reflected in our conversations and our work ethic. First, it is important that each member contributes, and that their opinions are respected and heard. Every idea we hear influences our work, and the more ideas we can hear means our project becomes more well-rounded. Additionally, everyone must respect one another and their opinions so we can have discussions that are respectful and creative. Finally, we value getting work finished, but more so doing good work overall. 
-	What leadership behaviors reflect these values?
As the leader of our group, or Project Manager Ty leads our conversations. In our conversations our manager makes our tasks clear but makes it clear that everyone should be asking questions, and should be heard, demonstrating out common values as a team. Additionally, in Ty’s absence we find that everyone still is able to talk and do our work, despite not having our manager. 
-	How do our leaders contribute to the success of our mission?
Leaders are inspiring, and beyond that leaders keep us on task and push us above and beyond. Without a leader and without checkups, our assignments may not be up to our standards, and we may create things that are not on task. With a leader, and with everyone in the group helping one another, we are able to go above and beyond in our work, creating something we could not do by ourselves.
-	What are 5 words that describe the idea leader?
Inspiring. Caring. Inclusive. Intelligent. Experienced.
-	How are decisions made?
Decisions for our group are made democratically. Everyone is allowed to influence one another and share their ideas and express concerns, but when ends meet ends decisions are made by the entirety of the group. When needed, or when a decision that is of less significance, the leader of the group may make the decision, with the thoughts of the team in mind. 
-	How do leaders grow?
Leaders grow and are essentially made, through struggle and adversity. This is similar to how anyone may grow as a person, but for a leader it is essential to work through adversity, because with experience comes knowledge. Therefore, the more knowledge one gains the more they can help their teammates and partners, meaning they need to struggle, and help others.
-	What does accountability look like?
Accountability is understanding that if you, a member of the group no matter if you are a leader or not, have to be able to take the blame for missing an assignment, or not doing an assignment that is to the standard that is necessary for the group. Additionally, accountability is the members of the group letting other members know that they have not done work up to the standard, or have been slacking off. This accountability creates an environment that is fair, but also helps everyone do good work. 
Our leadership philosophy is one that creates a safe, fair environment. We hope to have someone that pushes us to do better work, keeps everyone accountable, and holds themselves accountable.
